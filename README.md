Real-time Python Chat Application

Key features:

User Connection and Management:

-    When a user connects, they are assigned a random username (e.g., "User_1234") and an avatar.
-    User connections and disconnections are broadcast to others in the chat, showing who has joined or left.

Messaging:

-    Users can send messages to each other in real-time. Messages are displayed with the sender's username and avatar.
-    Messages are categorized as user messages or system messages. System messages display events like joining or leaving, while user messages are standard chat messages.

Username Update:

-    Users can change their usernames, and this update is broadcast to other users, so everyone sees the change in real-time.

UI:

-    The front-end, styled with CSS, displays the chat in a container with sections for messages, input fields for typing messages, and a button to send messages.
-    Users can view others' avatars, names, and messages in a styled chat window, with color schemes and message bubbles for a clean, user-friendly interface​(index)​(app).
